# Akshay Token Smart Contract

This is the readme for the Akshay Token smart contract. The Akshay Token is a simple Ethereum-based smart contract representing a basic token system.

## Overview

The Akshay Token is a straightforward smart contract that implements a token system with minimal functionality. It allows users to mint (create) and burn (destroy) tokens. The contract is implemented in Solidity, and it is designed to be used on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Contract Details

### Token Information

- **Name:** Akshay
- **Symbol:** AK
- **Total Supply:** 0

The Akshay Token includes basic information such as the token name, symbol, and the total initial supply, which is set to 0.

### Functions

1. `mint(address _address, uint256 _value) public`: This function allows anyone to mint (create) tokens for a specified address. It increases the total supply of tokens and adds the specified amount to the balance of the given address.

2. `burn(address _address, uint256 _value) public`: Users can call this function to burn (destroy) a specified amount of tokens from a particular address. It checks if the address has a sufficient balance before reducing the total supply and the balance of the given address.

### Balances

The contract utilizes a mapping from addresses to uint256 values to maintain the token balances for different users.

## Solidity Version

This contract is written in Solidity and is designed to be used with Solidity version 0.8.18.

## Usage

The Akshay Token smart contract is a basic example of a token system. Users can mint and burn tokens using the provided functions. The total supply is initially set to 0, and it increases when tokens are minted and decreases when tokens are burned.

## Disclaimer

This code is provided as a simple example and for educational purposes. It does not include advanced features like access control or the full functionality of a standard ERC-20 token. Use it at your own risk and make sure to understand its limitations before deploying it to the Ethereum network.
